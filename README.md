DVDgotchi
=========

This is a simplified tamagotchi clone using only DVD menus.
It should play on any DVD player (including VLC). Please
see the releases for the ISO. It only contains two meters:
food and happiness. They decline randomly. If one of them
reaches 0 your DVDgotchi dies. If you turn off your DVD
player your DVDgotchi dies as well.

The DVDgotchi is Rover from Windows XP. Thank you, 
Microsoft! I do miss him :-(

Compilation requires Python 3.13 and DVDStyler.

Made by [Koen van Hove](https://koenvh.nl) because I wanted
to see whether I could.
